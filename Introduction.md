# Introduction to the Historical-Critical Method

The Historical-Critical method is completely different from the Devotional approach to church history and scriptural studies.

The devotional approach to the Bible, Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith History, and Church History is concerned about what the scriptures and history have to say to inspire faith and what it inspires us to believe about ourselves and society.

Some questions the devotional approach would have us ask are: 
* What do these things say about God, Jesus Christ, the prophet Joseph Smith? The church? My relation to God, the church, and the world? 
* What does it tell me about what I should believe? About how to act? About my social responsibilities? About how I should interpret current events? 
* How do they help me to live?

In the words of Bart Ehrman, "The historical-critical approach has a different set of concerns and therefore poses a different set of questions. At the heart of this approach is the historical question (hence it's name) of what the . . . [scriptural] writings meant in their original historical context."

Some questions the historical-critical approach would have us ask are: 
* What happened in early church history? In what order? 
* How did doctrines and beliefs evolve over time? 
* What were the circumstances under which they happened and were recorded? 
* What sources of information did each of these primary sources use to author their accounts? 
* What issues were they trying to address in their own day? 
* How were they affected by the cultural and historical assumptions of their time? 
* When were these sources produced? 
* Is it possible that the perspectives of these sources differed from one another and in what way? 
* What may have caused certain doctrinal teachings to change over time? 
* Are there any contradictions in the record? If so, what may be the reason? 
* Is it possible that what the writings originally meant in their original context are not what they taken to mean today, if so, in what way?
* What do we do about the absence of the original source artifacts of the Book of Mormon? 
* What do we do about the contradictory interpretation of artifacts we do have the original texts for (e.g., paypri)? 
* What were the potential biases and agendas of the people involved at each stage? Do these contextual biases add to the interpretation of what may have happened?

In short, the goal of the historical-critical method is to arrive as closely to the truth of what actually was happening in the past. We are to seek learning out of the best books, to study things out in our minds (i.e., use logic). 

{what constitutes "best"} â€” Devotional approach is anything that promotes faith. Historical-critical approach is meticulous adherence to methodologies that allow us to reconstruct the past as they actually happened. 

So I hope that eventually, you will see the powerful logic behind the historical-critical method and have a new tool and perspective with which to view the world with an analytical mind that you can then ask God if it is right.
